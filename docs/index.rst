Welcome to the UmbrellaPipeline documentation!
==============================================

What is the UmbrellaPipeline?
-----------------------------

The tool automatically creates a ligand unbinding pathway based on the sterics of a protein/enzyme.
It then creates starting conformations along this pathway and runs umbrella sampling. The trajectories
can then be analysed using this tool and PMF Values can be calculated.
